Vicki Stanfield : Redirecting Input and Output in Linux
=======================================================

Created by Vicki Stanfield, last modified on Feb 20, 2022

Every process in Linux uses three open files called file descriptors. These files are the standard input, standard output and standard error files. By default :  

**Standard Input** is the keyboard, abstracted as a file to make it easier to write shell scripts.

**Standard Output** is the terminal from which the script runs, also abstracted as a file to make writing scripts & program easier.

**Standard error** is similar to standard output but contains only the errors.

  
If you have a command job that you want to write the output to a file for, add `>/tmp/outfile` to the end of the command, and what would have been written to the terminal, will instead be saved to a file on the filesystem called /tmp/outfile. If you want to add to an existing file use `>>/tmp/outfile` instead.  
  
If you need to only redirect the output from the stderr (standard error), use `2>/tmp/outfile`  
  
If you want both to go to the file, use `>/tmp/outfile 2>&1`
